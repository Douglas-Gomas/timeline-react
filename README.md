## Overview

This project is a timeline component for visualizing events in a clear, space-saving layout. Events are arranged to minimize lane usage, so events that don’t overlap will share the same row. I’ve added features for editing, dragging, and customizing events, aiming to make the component user-friendly and versatile.

## How to start

```
To use the starter code: navigate to this project directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies (this takes a couple minutes), and then run `npm start` to initialize and connect to a node server with your default browser. Please feel free to use as much or as little of the starter code as you'd like.

## About Task

* How long you spent on the assignment.

I spent about 4 hours and 48 minutes on this project.

* What you like about your implementation.

- You can create events in different time views (day, week, month), making it feel more like a calendar. Events are also editable and draggable.
- Double-clicking lets you edit event details right in the timeline, which feels smooth and user-friendly.

* What you would change if you were going to do it again.

- I'd refine the layout for a cleaner look, making it even easier to understand at a glance.
- Tooltips would help display details when hovering over events, improving usability without cluttering the timeline.

* How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.

If I had the chance to do this again, I’d focus even more on making the timeline visually intuitive and familiar. My inspiration came from popular calendar layouts, and I’d continue that approach by refining the color coding for event types like tasks, holidays, and birthdays. This way, each event type would have a distinct look, making it easier for users to identify event types at a glance.

* How you would test this if you had more time.

With more time, I’d add thorough testing, including:
Unit Tests: To ensure each component (e.g., event rendering, resizing) works independently.
User Testing: Feedback on usability could help fine-tune the interactivity and layout.
